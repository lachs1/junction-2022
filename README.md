# ENOP - advanced machine learning aided ENergy OPtimization tool

## 1. Introduction

Majority of Europe is highly dependent on Russia in terms of energy, and as we all know, the situation is currently far from ideal. Especially during this year, the price of electricity has risen because of the high demand of natural gas and uncertainty on the energy markets. Even Finland's transmission system operator (Fingrid Oyj) has announced that everyone should be prepared from electric outages during the coming winter [1].

It's self evident that situations like these require fast, effective and simple solutions so we don't have to suffer from electric outages and high electricity prices. In addition, solving issues like has also a positive effect on reducing CO2 emissions: if we can schedule our consumption to the hours when the price of electricity is cheap, we are most likely using renewable energy sources, like wind power. In addition, with a smart scheudling like this brings also financial benefits.

## 2. Project description

Since the price of electriciy is available only one day ahead, the first question that come to our mind was the following: "How can we have more flexilibility in scheduling our consumption?" In our solution, we decided to implement a machine-learning algorithm that can predict the price of electricity based on simple parameters: temperature, wind speed, date and time. With this flexility in hand, individuals, businesses, schools and factories can schedule their consumption with much more freedom.

The second point our team tackled was to come up with an idea on how can we get all, induviduals and businesses to participate in saving energy.

Measure, track, reduce & repeat. It is as simple as that to reduce CO2 emissions, save money and stop overloading the electric grids.

Measure, track, reduce & repeat.  ENOP (ENergy OPtimizer)  is an energy consumption optimizer that can display the electricity consumption measurements of an individual or business user, no matter which electricity provider supplies the electricity. In addition, the optimizer tracks how well the energy consumption has been scheduled during the past day, week, month, and year and indicates the outcome using intuitive "energy points". As a cherry on top, ENOP uses a state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithm to predict the price of electricity more than one day ahead so individuals and businesses can schedule their consumption with more flexibility.

What challenges do we precisely solve with our solution?
Electricity prices can be fetched, but only up to one day ahead. This enables users to optimize their energy usage depending on the prices. But how do you know
